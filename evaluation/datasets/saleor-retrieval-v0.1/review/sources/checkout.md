### Why Is There No Cart Model?[​](#why-is-there-no-cart-model "Direct link to Why Is There No Cart Model?")

Saleor has no distinct object type for shopping carts and checkouts. We wanted the same features – like discounts, vouchers, address-specific taxes, and shipping estimates – to be available in the cart and the checkout, so we've decided to use the same object type for both.
Checkout provides the interface for standard cart operations like adding products or promo codes. It can also be processed in almost any order, for example, by saving a billing address before adding any items.

### Glossary[​](#glossary "Direct link to Glossary")

* **Checkout**: Object that groups all the data needed for the checkout process and creating an order.
* **Checkout Line**: Items added to the checkout with quantity data. Each added variant has a separate line.
* **Checkout Completion**: During this step, payments may be processed and stocks may be reserved. If requirements are met, the order is created.
* **Payment Gateway**: Payment App or legacy plugin. e.g., [Adyen](/developer/app-store/apps/adyen/overview), [Stripe](/developer/app-store/apps/stripe/overview).

## Permissions[​](#permissions "Direct link to Permissions")

A checkout is identified by a UUID-based ID.
Anyone who knows this ID can query or modify the checkout.

The table below shows what is publicly accessible when you know the checkout ID,
and what requires ownership or staff/app permissions.
